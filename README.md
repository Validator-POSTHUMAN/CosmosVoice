### Details:

We warmly invite ***everyone*** to share insights about their Cosmos-related projectsâ€”or even those that are unrelatedâ€”and to engage with the community by answering any questions that arise. However, ***we donâ€™t engage*** in shilling or paid promotions; our efforts are driven solely by our passion and enthusiasm for the Cosmos Ecosystem.

> The **duration** isn't pre-defined. If the community wants to speak for five hours straight, weâ€™re up for it! However, speakers are welcome to stay with us for as long as theyâ€™re comfortable. :)

> We've already engaged with numerous founders, community managers, validators, and teams (I'm currently compiling a list), and you're welcome to suggest others who you believe are reliable.

### Oh, wow! When? How? 

Every week at 9 AM UTC, we gather here in the Cosmos Ecosystem Russian-Speaking [Telegram](https://t.me/CosmosEcosystem_ru), where the Interchain journey begins! We believe that bridging the gap between English-speaking founders and community members and Russian-speaking Cosmos enthusiasts is crucial for fostering decentralized and interoperable structures.

### How It Works:

The process is simple: Our guest joins the session and waits a few minutes while we (mostly me) review comments from the previous recording on YouTube. Once that's done, the discussion begins. Typically, the speaker introduces themselves and their project, and then highlights or discusses any topics they want to emphasize.

> During the session, our guest speaks a few sentences, and then the host translates this into Russian for our listeners. This back-and-forth continues throughout the session.

> Smile, you're on record! Every session is recorded so that others can enjoy the conversation later on!

### How to Enhance Your Presence:

Here are a few optional tips to help you make the most of your appearance:

- **Use your laptop/phone camera**: Engaging with the community through video helps build a stronger connection. The community appreciates seeing real people. While we respect everyone's choice to remain anonymous, using video can help protect the community by promoting transparency.

- **Prepare key points**: Jot down some notes about your project or key topics youâ€™d like to cover during the session.

- **Show, don't just tell:** As the saying goes, "Better to see once than hear a hundred times." Consider demonstrating your website, application, or tools to visually reinforce your message.

### Post-Session:

After the session, we'll publish the recording with timestamps on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT8g3Ki-EO0UHhP2DFPXi2A) (to our 10.5k subscribers) and [Omniflix TV](https://omniflix.tv/cryptobase), where we are is the leading channel by the number of published videos.

If our guest is an English speaker, our Content SubDAO will usually prepare an English extract ([Example](https://x.com/POSTHUMAN_DVS/status/1820372697387557008/video/1)), which weâ€™ll share on our [X account](https://x.com/POSTHUMAN_DVS). :)

### What's Required from the Speaker Before Joining?
Not much, just a few details for our announcement:

- **Your Name and Role**
- **Topic**: A brief description of what we'll be discussing
- **Logo or Picture**: To include on the poster
- **Project Link**: A link to your project
